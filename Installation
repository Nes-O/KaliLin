I installed VMware.
In the official website of Kali there is Get Kali and in that I chose virtual machines
Selected the 64-bit for VMware torrent downloads.
Once the VMware gets installed in there I ran the image for the downloaded torrent
A lot of booting and setup takes place which are mostly automatic but you have to give your own username and password 
Forgetting that is bit of hassle so stay in touch with it.
once done the vibrant Kali image flares up and I dont think I had seen something so beautiful like fora long period of time
